A: Alright, everyone, let’s start. Today, we’re discussing whether a cashless society is good or bad. It’s something we see happening more and more, especially in places like China. Shops and businesses seem to prefer digital payments over cash. What do you all think? Why do so many shops encourage mobile payments instead of accepting cash?

C: I think the main reason is convenience. When you pay with cash, both the customer and the shop have to spend time counting money, checking for fake notes, and handling change. But with a QR code or a mobile payment app, everything is done in just a few seconds. You just scan, confirm, and it’s paid. This speeds up transactions and makes business operations smoother. Also, shops don’t have to worry about handling and storing large amounts of cash, which reduces the risk of theft. In China, this has become the norm, and I think other countries might follow this trend soon.

B: Uh… yes, I think… um… shops, uh, like QR code because… uh… very fast. No need to… uh… take out money, no need… um… to wait for change. And also, uh… people don’t lose money, uh, I mean, cash. If, um, someone lose wallet… uh, money gone. But phone… you can, uh, lock it.

D: Yeah, I agree. I think another reason is that it’s safer for businesses too. If a shop has a lot of cash, it can be targeted by thieves. But if everything is digital, there’s no physical money to steal. Also, businesses can track transactions more easily. They don’t have to worry about mistakes in giving change or employees stealing from the cash register. Everything is recorded digitally, which makes accounting much easier for them.

A: That’s a great point! Digital payments reduce the risk of theft, not just for customers but also for businesses. But what about the downsides? Can a cashless society create any problems?

C: Definitely. One major issue is accessibility. Not everyone is comfortable using mobile payments, especially older people. Many elderly individuals still prefer cash because they may not have smartphones or find digital transactions too complicated. If we move too quickly toward a cashless society, we might leave behind people who don’t have the technology or the knowledge to use it properly.

B: Ah… yes. My grandma… uh… she don’t know… how use phone to pay. She only use cash. Uh… when she go market, she give money, take change. If… uh… no cash, she don’t know what to do.

D: That’s true. I’ve seen that happen as well. Some older people might even feel embarrassed to ask for help when using mobile payments. Also, what happens if someone’s phone battery dies? If you rely entirely on mobile payments and your phone runs out of battery, or if the system is down, you won’t be able to buy anything.

A: That’s a really important concern. And what about security? Are digital payments always safe?

C: Not always. Digital payments rely on technology, and technology isn’t perfect. Hackers can steal personal data if someone’s phone gets hacked, or if they use public Wi-Fi without proper security. Also, if there’s a system error, a power outage, or an internet issue, people might not be able to pay for things. That could be a big problem in emergencies.

D: Oh, I didn’t think about that. If there’s no internet or a technical problem with the payment system, does that mean I won’t be able to buy food or even take the bus? That sounds risky.

A: Exactly! That’s why some people argue that even in a cashless society, we should always have a backup payment method. Now, let’s talk about Hong Kong. Do you think Hong Kong should go completely cashless in the future?

B: Uhm… I think, uh… no… because, uh… some people… they… don’t have phone. And… uh… some people don’t trust… uh, internet. They think… uh… maybe money… uh… disappear.

D: Yeah, and Hong Kong still has a lot of small businesses that only take cash. If we go cashless too fast, they might lose customers, especially older people or those who don’t like digital payments.

C: But we also have to think about the future. Many people in Hong Kong already use Octopus cards, credit cards, and mobile payments like Alipay and WeChat Pay. Maybe in 10 years, cash won’t be necessary anymore. Most people will be used to digital transactions, and cash will slowly disappear naturally.

A: That’s an interesting prediction! Maybe by 2030, Hong Kong will be like China—almost completely cashless. But at the same time, we need to make sure that no one is left behind.

C: Right. Instead of forcing people to go cashless, we should give them a choice. Some people will prefer digital payments, and others will still want to use cash. A balanced approach would be the best solution.

D: Yeah, balance is important. I think digital payments are the future, but we should be careful not to rush it too fast.

B: Yes… balance… good.

A: Great discussion, everyone! I think we covered all the key points. We talked about why businesses prefer cashless payments, the problems that could arise, and what might happen in Hong Kong. Thanks for sharing your ideas!
