Mock 1: No more Paper
Money or Coins

A quick question: what do you take with you when you leave your house? Keys, wallet, and your phone, right? And people in China? I can tell you, most of the time, I just take my phone and just like me, there are now millions of people in China enjoying this cash-free life. The Chinese are now living in the People's Republic of Digital.
Super apps in China have changed our life, and introduced a new era where small change and cash has been left behind.
All is needed is a QR code, which can be found everywhere from the largest shop to the smallest stores.

What's a QR code? It's a Quick Response barcode with a random pattern of tiny black squares against a white background.
Shoppers pay by scanning the code with their phones after selecting their goods. No cash is needed in the transaction and everything can be paid by one swipe of your phone.
The fact is, every morning when I go to buy breakfast at the street cart vendor, my 4RMB Chinese jian bing (a kind of pancake with vegetables and eggs inside, which is really yummy by the way), I can just scan, beep and walk off with my pancakes!
It sounds like China's started the transition to a cash-free economy faster than anyone could have imagined. Experts say by 2030 China will be for all intents and purposes, cashless!
This is China.
