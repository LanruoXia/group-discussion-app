Mock 2: The Future of Transportation

Self-Driving Cars – A Road to the Future

A quick question: What’s the first thing you do when you sit in a car? Fasten your seatbelt, start the engine, and grip the steering wheel, right? But in the near future, you might not need to do any of that. Imagine stepping into a car, telling it your destination, and then sitting back to relax while the car does all the driving for you.

Self-driving cars, once a thing of science fiction, are now becoming a reality. Companies around the world are testing autonomous vehicles that can navigate roads, detect traffic signals, and avoid accidents—all without human intervention.

How do they work? These cars rely on a combination of cameras, sensors, and artificial intelligence to “see” the road and make driving decisions. They can calculate the best routes, adjust speed automatically, and even predict the movement of pedestrians.

Just last week, I was in a fully autonomous taxi for the first time! I simply tapped my destination on an app, and the car smoothly took me there—no driver needed! Experts predict that by 2035, self-driving cars could dominate the roads, reducing traffic accidents and making travel safer and more efficient.

The future is on the move—are you ready for it?
